\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this work, we explored GPU acceleration of BV PRE and Ring-GSW PRE schemes and showed that GPUs are indeed capable of improving performance by more than an order of magnitude. Moreover, from our experiments, we found that GPUs are more effective in working with larger ring dimensions. We presented several lower level optimizations and parallel NTT implementations tailored specifically for GPU platforms which can be further extended to accelerate other FHE schemes and applications. 

In this direction, we would like to support the acceleration of other compute intensive tasks such as bootstrapping LWE FHE schemes, machine learning on encrypted data and other similar privacy concerning applications.
